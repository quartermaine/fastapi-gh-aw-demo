# Explanations

Understanding-oriented documentation that clarifies and illuminates the FastAPI GitHub Actions Workflow Demo project.

## Available Explanations

### Core Concepts

- [Application Architecture](architecture.md) - Understand the overall structure and design patterns
- [Design Decisions](design-decisions.md) - Learn why specific technologies and approaches were chosen
- [Development Workflow](workflow.md) - Understand the development process and best practices

## Purpose of Explanations

Explanations help you understand:

- **Why things are the way they are**
- **Context and background** for design choices
- **Connections between different parts**
- **Trade-offs and alternatives** considered
- **Broader concepts and principles**

## Explanation Characteristics

This section:

- Provides **context and background**
- Discusses **alternatives and trade-offs**
- Explains **the reasoning** behind decisions
- Makes **connections** between concepts
- Deepens **understanding**, not just knowledge

## When to Read Explanations

Read explanations when you want to:

- **Understand the big picture**
- **Make informed decisions** about changes
- **Learn best practices** and patterns
- **Contribute effectively** to the project
- **Evaluate** if this approach fits your needs

## Difference from Other Docs

Unlike other documentation types:

- **Not task-oriented** (like how-to guides)
- **Not learning-oriented** (like tutorials)
- **Not information-oriented** (like reference)
- **Understanding-oriented** - focuses on comprehension

## Topics Covered

### Architecture
Why the application is structured this way, what patterns are used, and how components interact.

### Design Decisions
The reasoning behind technology choices, code organization, and development practices.

### Development Workflow
How the team works together, why certain processes exist, and how they benefit the project.

## Future Topics

As the project evolves, we'll add explanations for:

- Database design and ORM choices
- Authentication and security approaches
- Caching strategies and trade-offs
- Testing philosophy and coverage goals
- Deployment options and considerations
- Performance optimization strategies
- Monitoring and observability approach

## Contributing Explanations

When adding explanatory documentation:

1. **Focus on the "why"** not the "how"
2. **Discuss alternatives** and trade-offs
3. **Provide context** and background
4. **Connect concepts** to each other
5. **Make it accessible** to various skill levels
