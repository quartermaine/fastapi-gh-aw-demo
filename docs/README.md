**[Getting Started Tutorial](./tutorial.md)**

A hands-on introduction that guides you through:
- Setting up your development environment
- Running the application for the first time
- Making your first API requests
- Understanding the project structure
- Making your first code changes

**Start here if you're new to the project!**

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem-Oriented: How-To Guides

**[Development Guide](./development.md)**

Practical guidance for common development tasks:
- Setting up your development environment
- Writing and running tests
- Code style and formatting standards
- Git workflow and commit conventions
- Pull request process
- Debugging techniques
- Performance optimization

**Use this when you need to accomplish specific development tasks.**

### ðŸ“– Information-Oriented: Reference

**[API Reference](./api-reference.md)**

Complete technical reference for all API endpoints:
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Parameter descriptions
- Status codes
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Error handling

**Use this as a lookup when you need precise technical details.**

**[Configuration Guide](./configuration.md)**

Detailed reference for application configuration:
- Environment variables
- Settings management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Security best practices
- Docker configuration
- Server deployment options

**Refer to this when configuring the application for different environments.**

### ðŸ”„ Understanding-Oriented: Explanation

**[Automation and Workflows](./automation.md)**

Explanation of automated workflows and documentation systems:
- GitHub Actions workflow automation
- Automated documentation updates
- DiÃ¡taxis framework implementation
- Workflow customization and best practices
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting automation issues

**Use this to understand how the project's automation works and how to customize it.**

## Documentation Standards

This documentation follows these principles:

### Clarity
- Written in plain English
- Active voice preferred
- Progressive disclosure (high-level overview first, details on demand)

### Accuracy
- All code examples are tested and functional
- Configuration examples match current implementation
- Links are regularly checked for validity

### Accessibility
- Clear headings and structure
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Descriptive link text
- Searchable content

### Maintainability
- Documentation treated as code
- Updated alongside code changes
- Version controlled with the project
- Regular reviews for accuracy

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! When contributing:

1. **Follow the DiÃ¡taxis framework**: Ensure content fits the appropriate category
2. **Test code examples**: All examples should be tested and working
3. **Use clear language**: Write for clarity and accessibility
4. **Update the index**: Add new documents to this README
5. **Check links**: Ensure all links are valid and point to the right place

### Documentation Style Guide

- **Headers**: Use sentence case (capitalize first word only)
- **Code blocks**: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- **File paths**: Use relative paths from project root
- **Commands**: Show full commands with expected output when helpful
- **Examples**: Provide multiple examples (curl, Python, JavaScript where applicable)
